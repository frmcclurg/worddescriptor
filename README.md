# Word Descriptor

This is the code for a PHP website that collected and stored three words from each of my wife's friends, in order to later to build a framed word cloud picture for her birthday.

## Features

* Displays the list of words that were entered previously by other friends.
* The words entered previously have a "similar" button that allows the user to pop up a dialog containing synonyms to those words that have already been entered.  The dialog also allows the user select and use those synonyms.
* The word fields possess an auto-completion lookup to assist in spelling the newly entered words correctly.
* A bootstrap framework enables website form to be displayed on a mobile device.

## Demo
